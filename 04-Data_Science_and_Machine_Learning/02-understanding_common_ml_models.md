# Understanding Common Machine Learning Models

In the world of data science, machine learning models play a pivotal role in uncovering patterns and making predictions from data. Microsoft Fabric provides a comprehensive platform to work with various machine learning models, each designed to address specific types of tasks and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Gain insights into different types of machine learning models
- Understand the applications and use cases for each model
- Learn how to choose the right model for your data science projects

## Classification Models

**Classification models** are used when the task involves assigning a label or category to input data. These models are commonly used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and medical diagnosis.

- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees:** Hierarchical structures that split data based on feature values to make predictions.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that improves predictive accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A model that finds a hyperplane to separate data into different classes.

## Regression Models

**Regression models** are employed when the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. These models are suitable for tasks like sales forecasting, price prediction, and demand estimation.

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts a value using a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
- **Lasso and Ridge Regression:** Linear regression variants that prevent overfitting by introducing regularization terms.
- **Decision Trees for Regression:** Similar to classification trees, but predict continuous values at the leaves.

## Clustering Models

**Clustering models** are utilized to group similar data points together. These models are helpful for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Divides data into 'K' clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters to capture different levels of similarity.
- **DBSCAN:** Groups dense regions while isolating sparse regions in the data.

## Recommender Systems

**Recommender systems** are vital for suggesting relevant items or content to users. These models are prominent in e-commerce, content platforms, and personalized recommendations.

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user-item interaction data to recommend items based on user similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends items based on the user's historical preferences and features of items.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to capture latent features.

## Time Series Models

**Time series models** are essential for forecasting values over time, making them suitable for stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and demand prediction.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model for time series data.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Captures trends and seasonality in time series data.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A type of recurrent neural network suitable for sequence prediction.


Understanding common machine learning models empowers data scientists to choose the right approach for various tasks. Microsoft Fabric offers a versatile platform to work with these models, enabling users to build predictive solutions across a wide range of industries and domains.
