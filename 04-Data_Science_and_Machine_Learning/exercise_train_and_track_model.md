# Exercise - Train and Track a Model in Microsoft Fabric

In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding of training and tracking machine learning models using Microsoft Fabric's experiment features. You will create an experiment, train a model using a notebook, and use MLflow to track the experiment's progress and metrics.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience with creating and managing experiments in Microsoft Fabric
- Practice training a machine learning model using a notebook
- Learn how to track experiment metrics and results using MLflow

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this exercise, ensure that you have:

- Access to Microsoft Fabric workspace
- Familiarity with the basics of machine learning and notebooks

## Exercise Steps

Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. **Create an Experiment**:
   - Navigate to the Data Science workspace in Microsoft Fabric.
   - Select the "Experiments" tab and click on "New Experiment."
   - Provide a meaningful name for the experiment and a brief description.
   - Configure the experiment settings, including the notebook and environment.

2. **Prepare Data and Notebook**:
   - Choose a dataset suitable for your experiment.
   - Create a new notebook or open an existing one for your experiment.
   - Load the dataset and perform any necessary data preprocessing.

3. **Train a Model**:
   - Implement and execute the machine learning training code in the notebook.
   - Utilize the appropriate libraries and algorithms for your chosen task.
   - Train the model using the prepared data.

4. **Use MLflow for Experiment Tracking**:
   - Import the MLflow library into your notebook.
   - Begin tracking the experiment using `mlflow.start_run()`.
   - Log relevant hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts during the experiment run.

5. **Complete Experiment and Analyze Results**:
   - After training the model, end the experiment run with `mlflow.end_run()`.
   - Navigate to the Fabric UI and locate your experiment.
   - Review the recorded metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts for the experiment run.

6. **Compare Runs and Refine Model**:
   - If you have multiple experiment runs, compare them to identify the best-performing model.
   - Iterate on hyperparameters, algorithms, or data preprocessing to improve model performance.

## Conclusion

Completing this exercise will give you hands-on experience in creating and managing experiments within Microsoft Fabric. By training a machine learning model, tracking its progress with MLflow, and analyzing experiment results, you will enhance your understanding of how to effectively use experiment features to improve model outcomes and make informed data science decisions.
