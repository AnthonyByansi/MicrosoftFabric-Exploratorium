## Microsoft Fabric's Lakehouse Foundation

At the heart of Microsoft Fabric lies the Lakehouse, built on top of the OneLake scalable storage layer. This foundation leverages Apache Spark and SQL compute engines for processing vast amounts of big data. A Lakehouse offers a unified platform that seamlessly integrates:

- The flexibility and scalability of a data lake's storage capabilities.
- The prowess to query and analyze data comparable to a data warehouse.

## Scenario Example

Consider a scenario where your organization has traditionally used a data warehouse to house structured data from transactional systems, including order history, inventory levels, and customer information. However, alongside these structured datasets, you've also accumulated unstructured data from sources like social media, website logs, and external providers. Managing and analyzing this diverse data using your current data warehouse infrastructure has proven challenging.

In response to this challenge, your company decides to enhance its decision-making capabilities by performing analysis on data from various formats and sources. For this purpose, your organization adopts Microsoft Fabric as the solution of choice.

Microsoft Fabric empowers your organization to efficiently process, manage, and analyze both structured and unstructured data through its cohesive lakehouse architecture.
