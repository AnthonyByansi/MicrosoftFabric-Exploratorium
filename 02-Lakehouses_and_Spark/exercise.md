4. Configure essential settings such as location and resource allocation.

### Task 2: Ingest Sales Data

1. Obtain sample sales data from your chosen source (e.g., CSV files, database).
2. Upload the sales data files into your newly created Lakehouse.
3. Utilize Dataflows (Gen2) to transform and prepare the data for analysis.
4. Load the transformed data into tables within the Lakehouse.

### Task 3: Query Lakehouse Tables

1. Access the SQL Endpoint of your Lakehouse.
2. Write and execute Transact-SQL queries to:
   - Retrieve sales data for a specific time period.
   - Calculate the total revenue generated.
   - Analyze inventory levels and identify popular products.

### Task 4: Generate Insights and Visualizations

1. Utilize Power BI to connect to the dataset derived from your Lakehouse tables.
2. Build a Power BI report that visualizes the sales trends and inventory insights.
3. Create visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and KPIs to represent the data.
